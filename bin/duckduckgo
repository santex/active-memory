=head1 NAME

duckduckgo - Command line tool to use the DuckDuckGo API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  duckduckgo facebook
  
  duckduckgo --batch facebook
  
  duckduckgo duck duck go

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This application queries the L<DuckDuckGo API|http://www.duckduckgo.com/api.html> and displays the result in a nice human-readable way or in a batch mode which could be used by a shellscript to automatically work with the DuckDuckGo API results.

The B<--batch> parameter tells the application to display the data in a more machine readable form.

The B<--forcesecure> parameter tells the application to not fall back to http if the https request failed.

The startup of the application takes some milliseconds longer cause of the compile overhead by L<Moose>. If you want to use a huge bunch of queries, you should consider L<Learning Perl|http://learn.perl.org/>, best directly the modern way with the free L<Modern Perl Book|http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html> available as L<PDF|http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/modern_perl_letter.pdf>. Then you can use the distribution L<WWW::DuckDuckGo> directly todo faster a bigger amount of queries
