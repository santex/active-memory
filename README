AI::MicroStructure - alive

DESCRIPTION

When writing code examples, it's always easy at the beginning:

    my $foo = "bar";
    $foo .= "baz";   # barbaz

But one gets quickly stuck with the same old boring examples. Does it
have to be this way? I say "No".

Here is AI::MicroStructure, designed to fulfill your metasyntactic
needs. No more will you scratch your head in search of a good variable
name!
