## Documentation

  genetically organised data in a semantic environment

  Sorry for this poor Documentation it will grow accordingly to the state of the
  project, currently all efforts go into securing the cornerstones required to
  change the way we accessing data, and the way data is stored itself.
  I understand by reference that it is almost impossible to understand what this
  project is about so i have to default to this silly anecdote of the rat in the 
  mase, searching the exit and the eagle which fly s above.
  You also could describe it as an extreme form of the semantic web which might
  be the beginning of this development.

  


#### Motivation behind the project

  ☞ [short term goal] 
    
  To implement the properties of the concept into a generic db environment.
  to reduce the distance to information and the energy required to get there.
  
  Accessing the full potential of data networks in a passive way 
  

  ☞ [long  term goal]
    
    creating better data from data automatically fitness regulated
    
    (data procreation)

    (data symbiosis)
    

  ☞ [anticipated emergence]

  ☞ [UI-LAB active-memory-front](https://github.com/santex/active-memory-front)

  ☞ [CORE   active-memory      ](https://github.com/santex/active-memory)

  ☞ [PDF info](https://github.com/santex/active-memory/raw/master/start-here.pdf)


#### Important algorithms

  ☞ [Unknown data](https://github.com/santex/active-memory/raw/master/unknown-data.pdf)
    done

  ☞ [AI Micro Structure](https://github.com/santex/active-memory/raw/master/doc/image/artee-1.png)
    blue-print done / implementation open

  ☞ [Data & Time to get it](https://github.com/santex/active-memory/raw/master/doc/image/query-surface.jpg)
    proof of concept is implemented great stuff,
    based on what I more or less discovered by incident i have started this project.

#### Some additional Knowledge Networks which add passive context

 * [Word net] done
 * [PDF/Text] running
 * [20.000 TV-Shows] running
 * [Wiki] open
 * [Bit-torrent] open

#### Status

  Not finished, any help is welcome

#### Implementation
