=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::state_flowers - The US State Flowers theme

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each US state has a state flower. This theme uses all of them. Note however
that while there are 50 US states, there are only 43 entries in this theme.
This is not a bug - there are 7 pairs of states that have a common state
flower. Which leaves 43 different flowers.
